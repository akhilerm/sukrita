        <br>

      <p class="light white-text abcd2">In a very short period of time, STEPS has been able to accomplish a lot in diverse fields:
      </p>
        <br>
      <ul class="collapsible popout" data-collapsible="accordion">
    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header a12"><i class="material-icons">turned_in</i>Education</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body abcd1">
        <p>
          <i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>We  at  STEPS,  have  taken  this  to  heart.  We  spend  time every weekend with  the underprivileged children of Balabhavan, Balikamandiram and Ashraya and organize educational and motivational activities. It is indeed one amongst our great joys to see the little faces light up when we visit them. We are also extremely proud to share that, due to the concerted efforts of a dedicated tutoring team, we have been able to achieve
        100% pass rate for the SSLC students in 2014- 15.</p>
<p>
  <i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>We have also been distributing school kits (including notebooks, pens etc) for students with limited means in selected UP schools, and  thus  reduce  their  financial  woes.  We were  able  to  distribute  240  school  kits  in
2014.
</p>
<p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>While we guide and support the less privileged outside TKM, we do not forget the misfortunes of our peers and batch mates. Keeping this in mind, we loan out books from our well maintained and periodically updated book library to students with financial constraints.
</p>
<p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>
The 2013-2017 batch also collectively donated their text books and study materials in loving memory of their friend Praveen Mohan to the succeeding year, which proved to be a boon to their juniors. We intend to continue this fine tradition in the years to come.

       <p>
        At STEPS, we are well aware that healing the festering wounds of the poor and needy requires a  triumvirate of  physical, spiritual and financial aid. We have tried our very best to provide these to as many people as we can.  Our social  service  schemes  that reflects  this  reality include:
        <p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>Visiting  Gandhibhavan,  Pathanapuram  and  interacting  with  the 800+  inmates and providing them with money, clothes and other essentials. A memorable incident we shall never forget was when we brought all  the mothers in Gandhibhavan to TKMCE on Mother's day to watch organized cultural and literary performances.

 <p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>Interactive sessions with  the inmates of Mahilamandiram and financially helping them within the constraints of our limited sponsorship. One of our proudest moments was when we supported the marriage of an inmate of Mahilamandiram.

      <div class="collapsible-body abcd1">
        <p>It was one of our finest and most established programs. We are firm believers in the fact that 'blood is meant to circulate, pass it on'.</p>

        <p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>We   host    mega   blood   donation camps  regularly. We  are motivated by the enthusiastic response of TKMites who turn out in huge numbers  to support  these  camps. We had  more   than  500 donors, a record amount, during Tezoro 2K15.</p>

        <p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>We also make it a point to regularly raise  awareness  of  students regarding blood donation. </p>

        <p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>It  is  in  recognition of  all  these activities that  the  IMA (Indian Medical Association) Kollam chapter awarded us second prize for raising awareness about blood donation.</p>

        <p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>"Charity is the most excellent way to honor the deceased". It is in light of these words that STEPS TKMCE volunteered to renovate the Kollam District hospital in fond memory of our departed friends Aju Prakash, Nixon Aby Mathew, Adil Shah, Arun K Sabu, Sijo George John and Syed Inzamam Thangal.</p>

        <p>Renovation was done on 24th, 25th, 26th, 31st January and 1st February 2015.  The district hospital being one of the busiest hospitals in Kollam and the primary source of health services in Kollam was the most relevant place for such an initiative. About 120
TKMites participated and repaired more than 60 equipments, many of them requiring specialized engineering knowledge. The fund for the initiative was jointly raised by STEPS and the hospital. Also STEPS was able to distribute food to a few patients on 26th January
2015.</p>

</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body abcd1">
        <p><i class="material-icons">turned_in_not</i>Everyday quite a number of people become victims of deadly blood disorder like leukemia and bone marrow cancer. Stem cell transplantation (PBSC) is often cited by medical experts as the only treatment for these blood disorders. Therefore students of TKMCE  conducted AARDRA 2015, a blood stem cell donation awareness  and donor registration  programme  in association with DATRI at various colleges across  10 districts in Kerala; Calicut,  Malappuram, Ernakulam, Kollam, Trivandrum, Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta.as part of Rithu ‚Äô15, the inter-collegiate cultural fest of TKM College of Engineering, held on 13th  to 16th of August,  resulting in a total participation of 4232 persons which account to 4.6 percent of India‚Äôs and 29% of Kerala‚Äôs total stem cell donation. The stem cell donation programme had been previously conducted in the college as
part of for the technical fest, TEZORO‚Äô15 too was a
great success.</p>
<p>
The proposed scheme involved an awareness programme where the students of interested colleges were educated about the importance and details of stem
cell donation and its sampling technique. A proper awareness of the working of stem cells and an idea of how stem cell donation contributes to a healthy life system were provided by volunteers from
    TKM College of Engineering.

students.
