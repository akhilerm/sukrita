              Sukrita ’16 is a mega event  aimed at the  empowerment of differently abled people, organized by STEPS TKMCE, over a period of one month.

Sukrita aims  to  empower and  motivate  the  differently abled  in  the  society  by providing them a unique opportunity to get nearer to the brilliant technical minds which can offer them with innovative solutions for their needs, Lok Adalat, where they could put forward  their  problems  to  the  concerned authority and  a  job  fair  to  make them  self- supportive.<br>

  By organizing Sukrita’16 we aim to:
              <br>
              Recognize and honor differently abled members of our society and provide them with all the support and help they need.
              <br>
              Create a venue where ideas are exchanged, services provided, mindsets reformed and words put to action.
              <br>
              Initiate a chain of events that would later on garner greater support and empowerment of incapacitated individuals.
